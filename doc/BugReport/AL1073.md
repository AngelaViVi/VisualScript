ALINK : warning AL1073: 引用的程序集“mscorlib.dll”针对其他处理器

The issue can be avoided by using the AL.EXE that matches the platform (or bitness) you are attempting to build. That is, you'll see that when you are building x64, that it is trying to use AL.EXE at a path similar to

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.6 Tools

If you can get it to use the x64 version of AL.exe, the issue will go away. That is, use the AL.EXE at a path similar to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.6 Tools\x64

Msbuild finds this path by using its TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory. Thus, using the assumption that this directory is the correct directory when building x86, the workaround below essentially appends the x64 sub directory on to the path when building x64 and leaves it as is otherwise:

1. Create an MsBuildAL1073WarningWorkaround.targets file (name doesn't matter) and add it to the project. It has the following contents:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory Condition=" '$(PlatformTarget)' == 'x64'">$(TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory)$(PlatformTarget)\</TargetFrameworkSDKToolsDirectory>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>  
```
2. Edit the .csproj file to import this file near the end of the file (where you'll see the comment that says "To modify your build process...":

```
 <Import Project="MsBuildAL1073WarningWorkaround.targets" />
 <!-- To modify your build process... -->
```
